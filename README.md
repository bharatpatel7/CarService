# Car Database Management System

This is a simple command-line based car database management system implemented in C. It provides various functionalities to manage a list of cars such as adding new cars, loading data from a text file, searching cars, sorting cars, and more.

## Description

This project aims to create a basic car database management system using C programming language. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface to interact with the database, allowing users to perform various operations on the stored car data.

The system allows users to add new cars to the database by providing details such as car make, model, year, etc. It also supports loading data from a text file into the database, enabling users to import car information from external sources.

Searching functionality is implemented to facilitate finding specific cars based on their unique identifiers (carId) or attributes such as model and type. Additionally, the system provides options to print details of all cars, print details of a specific car by its index, count the total number of cars in the database, and remove car data.

To enhance usability, the system includes a sorting feature that allows users to sort the cars in the database based on their unique identifiers (carId). Furthermore, the system provides an option to remove all car data, offering a convenient way to clear the database when needed.

## Functions

1. **Add data on a new car:** Allows the user to add details of a new car to the database.
2. **Load data on cars from a given text file:** Loads data of cars from a text file into the database.
3. **Print data of all cars:** Prints details of all cars currently in the database.
4. **Print data of the nth car:** Prints details of the car at the specified index in the database.
5. **Search car data based on carId:** Searches for a car by its unique identifier (carId) and prints its details.
6. **Search car data based on model and type:** Searches for cars based on their model and type and prints their details.
7. **Count the total number of cars in the list:** Counts and prints the total number of cars in the database.
8. **Sort the cars in the list based on carId:** Sorts the cars in the database based on their unique identifiers (carId).
9. **Remove data of the nth car:** Removes the details of the car at the specified index from the database.
10. **Remove all car data:** Removes all car data from the database.
11. **Exit:** Exits the program.
